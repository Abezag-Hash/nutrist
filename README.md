Nutrition Pros and Cons on Blinklist
# how to run

I have to mention that to run this you have to first load this as a google chrome extension by going into settings, setting up dev mode and then loading this extension. Then the way to use this is to right click which will open the context menu clicking which on blinklist's item page will generate a nutritional pros and cons window. This window can be reviewed by going to the extension on the top right and clicking on that.
